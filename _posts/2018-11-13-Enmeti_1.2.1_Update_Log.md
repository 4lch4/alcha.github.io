## Is It Done Yet?

Of course not! If you've ever written code for a project you enjoy working on, you know the work is never truly done. You're always in a state of changing things or coming up with new ideas.

Lately, I've been working on adding translations to the text used by [Enmeti][2] as well as learning more about how VSCode handles various display languages. At this point, I've got a decent version of the extension working with support for English, Spanish, and French. Granted, the Spanish translations were done with Google Translate so there's no telling how accurate they are ðŸ˜…

I've got a few friends that will be doing more accurate translations of the strings used and then I'll update the extension accordingly. For the time being, it's a start at least!

## Next Features

At this point, I'm pretty happy with where it stands. I still have some work to do in regards to the translation support, and once that's complete I'll have finished everything on my original roadmap for Enmeti. I've got a few other ideas I'd like to add but I'll be taking a slower approach to pushing changes to the marketplace. After the last few releases, I noticed glaring issues that I'd have caught if I only used the extension a bit more before publishing that version.

The next idea I have in mind is adding the ability to insert links to a **Referenced Links** section near the bottom of the file in case you want to show all the links referenced in one section. Ideally, it would add the link reference to the bottom of the file like normal, but just above those hidden references, it would show a **Referenced Links** section that shows the URL's referenced throughout the file.

If you'd like to provide translations of the text into your own language, simply check out the [Strings.js][0] file and submit a PR with your additions. That said, if you have any comments, criticisms, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know ðŸ˜Š
