I am a software developer and founder/lead developer of [HassleFree Solutions, LLC.][01], a freelance development company that has a penchant for user-focused software that works seamlessly. I began my professional development career in 2015 at [SAPIEN Technologies, Inc.][02] (SAPIEN) after graduating from the [University of Arkansas at Fort Smith][00] with a Bachelor's degree in **Information Technology - Programming**. 

## Skills

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the languages, tools, utilities, etc., that I am confident I can work with and/or have worked with extensively in the past:

### Languages:
- [Java][17] **(6, 7, 8)**
- [Node.js][18] **(ES5 & ES6)**
- [PowerShell][19] **(2.0 - 6+)**

## Projects

I have been lucky enough to work on a wide variety of projects, such as creating [an Android app][21] from scratch that parses PowerShell help XML files for help on the go, to creating a [Discord chatbot][20] that is used by over 12,000 users. Here are some of the projects I consider noteworthy with some extra information:

### Tron

[Tron][20] is my longest lasting and most successful project. As of writing, it is currently on 100 different servers and has a user count of 13,975. One point of pride with this project is that nearly every command was added due to a feature request from someone who uses the bot. I'm very fond of the excitement when I add a feature that someone asked about previously. When they realize Tron can do what they wanted, they tend to use it a _lot_ more.

- Key Features:
  - Provides gif reactions to make a situation funnier, more serious, or whatever mood you're looking for.
  - Allows users to interact with one another through marriages, adoptions, and shipping.
  - Provides access to real-time Bitcoin pricing and conversions to over 150 currencies.
- Key Technologies Used:
  - [Node.js][18] 8
  - [MongoDB][13]
  - [Inter Process Communication][27]
  - [Discord.js Framework][23]
  - [Discord.js Commando Framework][22]
- Notable Packages Used:
  - [PM2][24]
  - [Canvas][25]
  - [Mongoose][26]

### iPowerShell

[iPowerShell][21] was my first major development project, and I had taken it on shortly after starting at SAPIEN. The CEO had previously built an iOS version of the app and wanted it ported to Android. I was confident in Java so I asked if I could do it, and was given the go ahead. Now the finished product is available on the Google Play Store and is maintained by SAPIEN.

- Key Features:
  - Connect to a remote server using SSH or PowerShell Web Access.
  - View help files for all the default Microsoft PowerShell cmdlets.
  - Add your own help files or the help files of other cmdlets.
  - Keep up to date with the latest news regarding PowerShell and SAPIEN.
- Technologies Used:
  - Java 7
  - Gradle
- Notable Packages Used:
  - nSoftware's [IP*Works! SSH Library][28]
  - Java XMLPullParser
  - YouTube and Twitter SDK
