# Who Am I?

Well, simply put, I'm yet another developer on the internet. I've been a professional developer since 2015 and an un-professional developer since 2009.

I am the founder and lead developer of [HassleFree Solutions, LLC.][8] which is a freelance development firm that I run with [a few others][9].

For a more formal "about me", check out my [Resume page][10] where you can get a copy of my official resume or just read some more information about myself.

## Contact Info

I've been on the internet for as long as I can remember, so I'm sure there are a number of links I'll be missing but here are my primary presences online:
